                   <p>As a recent graduate from UCLA, my goal is to eventually become a software engineer for companies that deal with
                        sports and gaming. As of right now, I am a marketing cloud application consultant for Oracle Digital, with experience
                        in SaaS cloud applications. Before I accomplish my goal as a software engineer for the previous industries mentioned, I want to gain 
                        some experience within my own company through software engineering. My plan to achieve this, is to complete the UCLA Coding Boot
                        Camp, and demonstrate my skills that I am highly qualified web developer.Once I gain the experince I need at Oracle Digital, I want to move 
                        on to my dream job and become a software engineer for industries such as sports and gaming.
                   </p>
                   <p id="para">In my free time I love to read, play video games, watch sports, and go outside. My favorite hobby is to watch live sports
                        in any of the Los Angeles stadiums. I'm a huge Los Agneles fan when in comes to the sports teams such as the Lakers, Dodgers, 
                         Kings, and the Rams. In addition, I love to watch sports outside of the United States such as soccer or futbol, my favorite teams in 
                        terms of futbol are Dortmund, Chelsea, and Real Madrid.
                   </p>
                   <p>My ulitmate goal is to eventually experience and work in a different country due to my passion for traveling. In addition, 
                        I love to travel, and been to 10 different countries. To accomplish this I plan to go above and beyond to work hard, market mayself and represent
                        my brand to be the best software engineer I can be.
